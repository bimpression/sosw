Release cycle
-------------

- Master branch commits are automatically packaged and published to PyPI.

- Branches for staging versions follow the pattern: ``X_X_X``

- Make your pull requests to the staging branch with highest number

- Latest documentation is compiled from branch ``docme``.
  It should be up to date with latest **staging** branch, not the master.
  Make PRs with documentation change directly to ``docme``.

Building the docs
------------------

To build the docs locally, run: ``sphinx-build -ab html ./docs ./sosw-rtd``

You can also use the built in python web server to view the html version directly from localhost
in your preferred browser.

.. code-block:: bash

 sphinx-build -ab html ./docs ./sosw-rtd; (cd sosw-rtd && python -m http.server)
